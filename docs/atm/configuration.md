# Configuring Your SelfServ ATM

![](/static/assets/banners/whg_atmconfig.png)

Want to customize your banknotes? This is the place.

!!!warning
This page assumes the user has basic knowledge of the Roblox scripting language, Luau.
!!!

Your default configuration module, found under `JSM | ATM V3` **->** `SystemConfig`, is structured as follows:

```lua
--[[ 
	           _______ __  ___
	          / / ___//  |/  /
	     __  / /\__ \/ /|_/ / 
	    / /_/ /___/ / /  / /  
	    \____//____/_/  /_/
 	          ATM v3

local Settings = {
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	["Currency"] = "£",
	["ATMCharge"] = nil,
	["CardFlash"] = true,
	["SecurityTimeout"] = 20,
	["Images"] = {
		TennerDecal = {"rbxassetid://5892488849","rbxassetid://5892491132"},
		TwentyDecal = {"rbxassetid://5892492516","rbxassetid://5892493276"},
		FiftyDecal = {"rbxassetid://5892494158","rbxassetid://5892493678"},
	}
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
}
return Settings
```

## General Settings

### Currency
=== `string`
The specified character will be used as a prefix to all monetary values wherever a price is indicated.

---

Example:
```lua
["Currency"] = "€"
```

!!!
Please be advised that this setting is purely cosmetic and does not involve any actual currency conversion.
!!!
===

### ATMCharge
=== `number?` 
This will be the amount that the ATM will charge for withdrawals. Set to `nil` to disable the fee.

---

Example:
```lua
["ATMCharge"] = 0.50
```

!!!warning
Heads up, update your ATM UI to reflect the cost of withdrawals.
!!!
===

### CardFlash
=== `bool`
Should the green light on the card slot flash when idle?

---

Example:
```lua
["CardFlash"] = false
```
===

### SecurityTimeout
=== `number`
Any number given will be the time required for the ATM to classify the interaction as _"Inactive"_ and terminate it automatically.

---

Example:
```lua
["SecurityTimeout"] = 16
```
===

### Images
=== `{ [string]: { string } }`
A dictionary of banknote image asset IDs, used to visually represent the cash denominations dispensed by the ATM.  
Each entry corresponds to a denomination (e.g. £10, £20, £50), and contains a pair of Roblox asset IDs representing the **front** and **back** of the note.


---

Example:
```lua
["Images"] = {
	TennerDecal = {"rbxassetid://123456789","rbxassetid://987654321"},
	TwentyDecal = {"rbxassetid://123456789","rbxassetid://987654321"},
	FiftyDecal = {"rbxassetid://123456789","rbxassetid://987654321"},
}
```

!!!warning
Heads up, remember always to include the `rbxassetid://` part.
!!!

## Finalizing

Now, using the examples provided, a complete module will look as follows:

```lua
local Settings = {
	["Currency"] = "€",
	["ATMCharge"] = 0.50,
	["CardFlash"] = false,
	["SecurityTimeout"] = 16,
	["Images"] = {
		TennerDecal = {"rbxassetid://123456789","rbxassetid://987654321"},
		TwentyDecal = {"rbxassetid://123456789","rbxassetid://987654321"},
		FiftyDecal = {"rbxassetid://123456789","rbxassetid://987654321"},
	}
}

return Settings
```
