# Add Products to your SCO

![](/static/assets/banners/whg_scoproducts.png)

Mmm... scanning.

!!! Tip
We recommend the usage of the Whitehill Tool Configurator Plugin [here](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/96844493449121). If you use the plugin, the process is fairly straightforward.

!!!warning
This page assumes familiarity with Roblox Studio's Explorer and basic model hierarchy manipulation.

=== Step 1 - Add the example Tools
Download and import the example Tools from [Axon](https://axon.whitehill.group). You will find an Operator Login Card, a Debit Card and an example Product.
===

=== Step 2 - Get the Item Data
Go to the example Product and find a BindableFunction named ``JSM | Item Data``. Inside of the BindableFunction, you will find Attributes. The Attributes are:
- **AgeRestricted**: (``boolean``) Determine if the Product is Age Restricted and if the SCO will need Assistance to continue.
- **Cost**: (``number``) How much the Product should cost when scanned.
- **EASActive**: (``boolean``) If the JSM EAS should alarm if the Product hasn't been paid for yet.
- **ItemImage**: (``string``) The Decal the SCO should show when scanned. Use ``rbxassetid://0``, where ``0`` is the Asset ID of the Decal.
- **LoyaltyCost**: (``number``) How much the Product should cost if a Loyalty Card has been scanned.
You can customize these to your liking.
===

=== Step 3 - Add the BindableFunction
Add the BindableFunction as a child to the Tool of your Product. Once that is done, you can try scanning your Product with your SCO.
